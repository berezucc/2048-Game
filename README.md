# 2048 Game

## Description
This is the final project for my ISC 4U1 class. Meant to design a practical and functional application to solve a problem. 

Update: 100% grade received for this assignment.

### Problem:
As a result of  the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students and teachers were forced to transition to distant online learning. With this new and unfamiliar form of learning, elementary school teachers have found it difficult to ensure students are attentive and concentrated on learning. In some cases, students have left class, played games during class, or even gone to sleep during lessons. Teachers need to search for different ways to teach concepts that can align with the attention span of young students on a computer.

### Solution: 
 Ultimately, the 2048 game designed by our group is meant to be an engaging and enjoyable educational game for elementary school students. 2048 allows students to play a fun computer game whilst also learning basic and advanced addition and critical thinking skills. 2048 teaches addition of numbers of the same value, also known as doubling, which is a fundamental math skill for grades 3 and higher. Furthermore, teaching this concept through a game will help in keeping students engaged and active during class, preventing them from leaving or zoning out.

## Installation
Built on repl.it using Java and Jswing.
 
## User Manual
### General Instructions:
Select game difficulty (Original or hard) from the main menu by clicking on the button.

### How To Play:
Use the arrow keys to navigate the board.
Shift the numbered blocks on the board.
Blocks can either be merged into another block of the same type, or an empty space.
Merged blocks are twice the value of the original blocks they were merged from.
The goal is to eventually get a block with a value of 2048 to win!

### 2048 Extended:
 The extended version of the game allows blocks greater than 2048.
User tries to reach a value of 131052.

### Important Advice:
Try to take your time and not rush.
Try to focus on the smaller numbers and build them into bigger ones to avoid the board filling up completely.
Avoid excessive movements, keep your moves concise so that each move is important.
